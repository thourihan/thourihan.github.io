I'm studying computer science at the University of Rhode Island. I plan on minoring in cyber security as well.

I chose to learn computer science because I love problem solving and the logic behind it. 

### Skills

I have experience with Python, C#, and Java.

You can find some of my games on [itch.io](https://source1012.itch.io/). These were all made as part of  _game jams_, competitions in which you only have a certain amount of time to create a game following a particular theme. I have published 3 games using Unity and the C# programming language, and 1 game using Godot and its native GD_Script language. 

I am currently looking for an internship for Summer 2021, and I hope to learn more about computer science as a principle and broaden my skills.

Thank you for visiting my website!
