I'm studying computer science at the University of Rhode Island. I plan on minoring in cyber security as well.

I chose to learn computer science because I love problem solving and the logic behind it. 

I have experience with Python, C#, and Java.

You can find some of my games on itch.io [itch.io](https://source1012.itch.io/). These were all made as part of a _game jam_, a competition in which you only have a certain amount of time to create a game following a particular theme. I have published 3 games using Unity and the C# programming language, and 1 game using Godot and its native GD_Script language.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/thourihan/thourihan.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
