I am pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science at the University of Rhode Island. Additioanlly, I am pursuing a minor in Math and Cybersecurity. 

I have experience with Python, C#, SQL, and Java.

I have participated in several _game jams_, or competitions in which you only have a certain amount of time to create a game following a particular theme. I have published 3 games using the Unity game engine and the C# programming language, and 2 games using Godot and its native GD_Script language. You can play all of these games on my [itch.io page](https://source1012.itch.io/).

I am currently looking for an internship for Summer 2022, and I hope to learn more about computer science as a principle and broaden my skills.
