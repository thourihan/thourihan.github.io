I am pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science at the University of Rhode Island. Additioanlly, I am pursuing a minor in Math and Cybersecurity. 

I have experience with Python, C#, and Java.

You can find some of my games on [itch.io](https://source1012.itch.io/). These were all made as part of  _game jams_, competitions in which you only have a certain amount of time to create a game following a particular theme. I have published 3 games using Unity and the C# programming language, and 1 game using Godot and its native GD_Script language. 

I am currently looking for an internship for Summer 2022, and I hope to learn more about computer science as a principle and broaden my skills.
