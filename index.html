      <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
      <p>Hello! I'm @thourihan, and I'm currently studying computer science at the University of Rhode Island.
      <br>I like being a part of game jams, competitions where you have a time limit to make a game entirely from scratch.
      <br>I have experience with two engines for these game jams: Unity and Godot.
      <br>I'm familliar with C# and Python, but I hope to expand my programming knowledge even further in the future.
      <br>
      <br>I chose to pursue computer science because I love problem solving. I'm always ready to be challenged, solve problems, and continue learning.
