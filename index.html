                <p>
                    I'm a Research Programmer at Boston Fusion, where I integrate and adapt
                    machine learning models for computer vision applications in national defense.
                    I work with architectures like transformers and joint embedding predictive
                    architectures (JEPAs), modifying them to meet our specific needs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before joining Boston Fusion, I graduated from the University of Rhode Island
                    in 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Data
                    Science, earning a 3.99 GPA. While in school, I worked as a Software Developer
                    at OMNI Digital Services, building full-stack websites and internal tools with
                    JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. I also completed a Software Development Co-op at
                    FM Global, contributing to a large-scale internal web application using React
                    and C#.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Outside of work, I’ve contributed to a range of academic and personal projects
                    involving machine learning, software development, and game design. Some of my
                    favorites include a deepfake detection system using EfficientNet and FasterViT
                    that placed first in a machine learning course competition and a sentiment
                    analysis visualization built during HackMIT, where my team earned third place
                    in the MIT-IBM Watson AI Track. I’ve also published several games on itch.io
                    using Unity and Godot.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I truly enjoy solving challenging technical problems and I'm always interested
                    in learning more and growing as a developer in this field.
