			<p>Hi, I'm Tim!</p>
			<p>I’m currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at URI with a minor in Cyber Security. I like playing guitar, video games, and coding. I’m interested in many areas of Computer Science, but mainly full-stack web development.</p>
			<p>I started learning how to code in C# to make small games with Unity, and then learned GDScript and started making games with Godot. I've made around 10 games in total, and have even participated in some game jams on itch.io.</p>
			<p> After exploring game development for some time, I decided to start learning web development. I went through 3 of FreeCodeCamp's courses (Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms, and Front End Development Libraries) and learned more about Web Development from other free online sources. Meanwhile, my Computer Science courses at URI were providing me general knowledge of the field of Computer Science with Python, and Object-Oriented Programming in C++. </p>
			<p> In Summer 2022, I landed my first Web Development Internship at Omni Digital Services. I worked with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript (jQuery), PHP, and SQL (MySQL) to build full-stack web applications. </p>
