            <p>Hi, I'm Tim.</p>
            <p>I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Rhode Island with a 3.99 GPA. During my time at URI, I also earned a minor in Data Science and completed additional coursework in Math and Cybersecurity. Currently, I'm gaining practical experience in software development through a co-op at FM Global, working with technologies like React and C#. </p>
            <p>Previously, as a Web Developer Intern at OMNI Digital Services, I developed a “project starter” tool to streamline the creation of new web projects. I also built multiple full-stack websites for local businesses using jQuery, PHP, and MySQL, and created custom software to meet company-specific needs.</p>
            <p>In addition to my academic coursework, I've enjoyed working on both academic and personal projects. I developed a deepfake detector using EfficientNet and FasterViT in my machine learning class at URI, achieving first place out of 14 teams. I also prototyped a character creation web app for the Education Department at URI, funded by the NSF. At HackMIT, my team created an interactive map displaying hospital patient sentiment, earning third place in the MIT-IBM Watson AI Track. I've participated in several game jams on itch.io, developing games in Unity with C# and Godot with GDScript.</p>
            <p>I truly enjoy computer science and tackling challenging problems, whether through team collaboration or independently. I'm always interested in learning more and growing as a developer in this field.</p>
